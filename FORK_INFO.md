```

## September 24, 2026 upstream merge

Upstream `main` at `db54cfb1` (Tracearr 2.5.0) brings deterministic,
case-insensitive list ordering, History sort-aware pagination, Jellystat
episode relinking, Plex duplicate-identity fixes, Seerr request corrections,
Expo push-token validation, persistent-cache diagnostics, dependency updates
and translations. Migration `0108_warm_toad` remains identical to upstream;
Dispatcharr migrations stay in their separate, unchanged ledger.

Library query conflicts adopt upstream first-row guards; Jellystat retains
both upstream relinking and the fork's media-stream array validation. Locale
conflicts retain upstream translations plus the fork's channel-count and
upstream-version keys. Dispatcharr auth, session metadata, library/Seerr
exclusions, uncropped artwork and cache markers remain intact. Exactly the
PR-only CI and fork GHCR release workflows remain, unchanged; upstream
Renovate and Vouch metadata stay removed. Both Dockerfiles retain fork
metadata and fork migrations while adopting server-only runtime dependencies.

Full non-Docker validation passed on the first run with Node 24 / pnpm 12.4.2,
`HUSKY=0`, a 4 GB heap, a clean Turbo cache and frozen-lockfile install:
lint, typecheck, translations, unit/services/routes/auth/security, web,
coverage and build. Server groups plus web passed 9,037 tests with no skips;
shared passed another 384. Coverage passed 5,796 tests (70.40% statements,
64.21% branches, 74.58% functions, 71.63% lines). Upstream fixes the previously
skipped Plex auth test and removes an empty poller placeholder. Lint reports
751 warnings, down two; runtime/build counts and normalized warning classes
match the preceding baseline. Automated Dispatcharr auth/settings, lifecycle,
images, termination and History regressions passed. Logs use
`.tmp/github-ci-<job>-20260924.log`; the runner exits 0 with `FAILED_JOBS=0`.
Docker integration, E2E and image builds are omitted at the user's request;
migration execution and database upgrade paths are not covered. Live-provider
manual smoke checks have not been performed.

## September 25, 2026 — Dispatcharr device identity

Dispatcharr `client_id` identifies a connection, not a physical device. Keep
its existing `deviceId`, `sessionKey` and termination/cooldown keys intact.
Device views and automation comparisons instead use `dispatcharrDeviceId`,
a versioned SHA-256 of the JSON tuple `[serverId, serverUserId, trimmedUserAgent]`.
IP, media and playback kind are deliberately excluded. The exact same agent
on one server account is one logical device, including parallel connections;
a different agent/version or account/server is a different device.

Fork migration `0005_dispatcharr_user_agent` adds nullable text to sessions.
New Dispatcharr sessions store their full agent (empty string for missing);
other providers leave this column NULL. Read-time SQL recovers older agents
from product/player_name and treats the three parser placeholder names as
missing. Previously truncated agents cannot be recovered. This groups the
entire history without rewriting connection IDs or compressed chunks. New
missing-agent sessions share one unknown device per server account.

History/detail APIs and active sessions add optional `dispatcharrDeviceId`;
existing `deviceId` retains its provider meaning. User Devices returns the
stable identity in its existing deviceId field. The raw text column is not
part of session API payloads. SQL and TypeScript helpers must stay equivalent.
Device counts, new-device triggers and same-device exclusions use this identity;
concurrent playback lifecycle and termination still use connection identity.
Plex/Jellyfin/Emby retain their previous behavior. Old active cache entries are
enriched from their server type and preserved agent on read.

Validation passed with Node 24 / pnpm 12.4.2: lint (751 warnings), typecheck,
translations, unit/services/routes/auth/security/web (9,051 tests), coverage
(5,807 tests; 70.42% statements, 64.28% branches, 74.65% functions, 71.64% lines)
and build. Focused PG18/Timescale 2.29.1 integration passed: three device/upgrade
cases and three location-reader cases. E2E exited 0 with 55 passes and one
automation-editor retry. Logs: `.tmp/github-ci-devices-<job>-20260925.log`.
The broad integration attempt ran out of disk during the large catalog fixture;
it is incomplete. No PG15 or live-provider manual smoke was performed. Test
containers/volumes were cleaned up. Services/coverage have one additional
existing MaxListenersExceededWarning each; no new normalized warning class.

## What This Fork Adds

The primary fork-owned change is first-class Dispatcharr support. The fork lets Tracearr track Dispatcharr Live TV and VOD streams alongside Plex, Jellyfin, and Emby.

General fork rule:

- When upstream changes touch server models, auth flows, polling/realtime, or UI around media-server management, treat Dispatcharr support as an intentional overlay that must be ported forward explicitly. Do not assume those changes are incidental drift that can be dropped during merge conflict resolution.

User-facing Dispatcharr behavior:

- Add Dispatcharr as a selectable server type.
- Connect to Dispatcharr with either an API key/JWT token or username/password credentials.
- Edit an existing Dispatcharr server in place to switch between API key/JWT token auth and username/password auth without deleting and re-adding the server.
- Cache username/password JWT acquisition by a non-reversible fingerprint of
  the complete credential set, preserving cross-client single-flight without
  allowing a warm token to validate a changed password.
- Use username/password mode for WebSocket-capable realtime updates; API-key mode falls back to REST polling.
- Legacy Dispatcharr servers upgraded from older fork versions remain in polling mode until username/password credentials are entered again, because older stored tokens do not contain recoverable credentials for automatic migration.
- Show Live TV streams, VOD movies, and VOD shows.
- Dispatcharr does not provide a Media library catalog or VOD library synchronization; it remains supported for sessions, history, Live TV/VOD streams, and user synchronization.
- Optionally ignore streams reported as anonymous.
- Terminate Dispatcharr live/VOD streams from Tracearr.
- Display Live TV channel/programme information, channel logos, stream bitrate, codecs, resolution, and FFmpeg speed where available.
- Jellyfin and Emby Live TV sessions are enriched from `/LiveTv/Programs`; the current programme is stored in `mediaTitle` while the channel remains in `live.*`. The EPG cache is shared per server/channel and refreshes the existing poller at programme boundaries. Web and mobile Live TV cards use the same channel-title/programme-subtitle layout as Dispatcharr; Plex keeps its legacy Live TV card for now.
- Show Dispatcharr active sessions immediately from healthy WebSocket snapshots.
- When a Dispatcharr Live TV channel gains its first client, enrich its card
  from the detailed channel status immediately and retry for up to ten seconds
  while Dispatcharr initializes stream metadata. This avoids waiting for a
  later `channel_stats` update; retries stop when core technical fields arrive
  or the channel becomes inactive.
- Reconcile connector-owned server configuration (type, name, normalized URL,
  token, and anonymous-stream filtering) on the Redis leader, replacing stale
  connectors after local or cross-replica edits.
- Dispatcharr Live TV, VOD, and catch-up sessions use the shared pending playback lifecycle: they become history after the global 30-second confirmation threshold. While a session is pending, every REST/WebSocket snapshot refreshes its metadata in place and retains the highest observed progress.

The fork also carries local maintenance/distribution changes:

- README has fork-specific warnings, Docker image names, and Dispatcharr feature notes.
- Exactly two GitHub Actions workflows are allowed: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
  (only PR `opened` / `synchronize`) and the fork-owned
  `.github/workflows/fork-ghcr-release.yml` (only `release: published`).
  GHCR publication is the sole allowed automation outside PR validation.
  Never delete, replace, or overwrite this workflow with upstream automation.
  Follow `MERGE_INSTRUCTION.md` when reconciling upstream workflows; verify
  manually that exactly these two workflows remain after every merge.
- Releases are still created manually. A published stable `vX.Y.Z-rN` release
  (N >= 1) builds both existing Dockerfiles, without cache, for `linux/amd64`
  and `linux/arm64` on native `ubuntu-24.04` and `ubuntu-24.04-arm` runners.
  All four builds use the same resolved release commit and build timestamp.
  Like upstream, Buildx pushes images by digest, then assembles multi-platform
  manifests. All four builds and digest artifacts must succeed before any
  versioned tag or stable alias is published; failed builds may leave untagged
  content in GHCR. It publishes
  `ghcr.io/d4rk-4lchemy/distracearr` tags `X.Y.Z-rN`, `latest`, `standalone`,
  `supervised-X.Y.Z-rN`, and `supervised`, with fork version metadata and GHCR
  as `APP_IMAGE_REPO`. Prereleases are skipped; malformed stable tags fail.
  Authentication uses `GITHUB_TOKEN` with `contents: read` / `packages: write`.
  Docker Hub remains entirely manual; do not introduce Docker Hub credentials,
  scheduled/nightly/insiders builds, manual-dispatch, tag-push, release creation,
  Helm pushes, issue automation, Renovate, stale, or Vouch workflows.
- GHCR manifest publication checks all five tags for both Linux architectures.
  Preserve the variant/architecture artifact names and the shared publication
  gate when merging upstream changes. Registry updates across tags are not
  atomic; a publication failure can require rerunning the failed job.
  The September 25 workflow change passed actionlint, Prettier and local
  mocked-Docker checks for metadata, digest handling, publication gating and
  platform verification. Actual native builds and registry publication were
  not run locally; verify them in the next GitHub release run.
- Preservation is documented in `MERGE_INSTRUCTION.md` and this file; no
  CODEOWNERS changes or extra CI policy checks are required. Historical merge
  notes below describe the earlier CI-only/manual-release policy; this policy
  takes precedence.
- The Snyk security workflow and README badge are disabled in this fork.
- The Docker-backed integration matrix (PG15/Timescale 2.28 and PG18/Timescale
  2.29) is intentionally not part of GitHub PR CI. Run it manually when
  validating database, migration, or integration-test changes.
- Local Husky hooks were removed.
- `.tmp/`, `.plans/`, `AGENTS.md`, and this `FORK_INFO.md` are ignored locally.
- `AGENTS.md` documents the Pull Request CI workflow warning baseline. Read both `AGENTS.md` and this file before making changes, and update either file when a change affects repo instructions, fork overlay behavior, validation workflow expectations, warning counts, or future merge guidance.

## Typical Dispatcharr-Specific Changes

Most fork-only changes made for Dispatcharr fall into a few recurring categories:

- Shared model extensions:
  - add `dispatcharr` to server enums, schema validation, and frontend/backend shared types
  - carry Dispatcharr-only settings such as auth mode and anonymous-stream filtering
- Server configuration flow:
  - accept both token-based auth and username/password auth
  - allow switching auth mode in place while editing an existing server
  - avoid exposing stored token values back to the frontend response shape
- Realtime and polling:
  - use a dedicated Dispatcharr realtime connector instead of the existing Plex/Jellyfin/Emby SSE path
  - keep fallback polling when realtime is unavailable or when token auth cannot support realtime
  - bypass normal poller processing while healthy Dispatcharr realtime snapshots are active
- Session semantics:
  - treat Live TV and VOD differently
  - use the shared pending confirmation lifecycle for Dispatcharr Live TV, VOD, and catch-up
- Metadata and media presentation:
  - map channel/programme-specific live metadata
  - classify Dispatcharr catch-up/timeshift sessions as Live TV with estimated progress and a separate playback kind
  - support Dispatcharr images, logos, codecs, bitrate, and FFmpeg speed details
- Termination and sync:
  - route session termination through Dispatcharr-specific identifiers/endpoints
  - sync Dispatcharr users through the generic server sync path
- Frontend/mobile presentation:
  - expose Dispatcharr as a first-class server option
  - show Dispatcharr-specific setup guidance, polling/realtime state, and Live TV labels/cards/history rows
- Tests:
  - cover Dispatcharr parser/client/realtime behavior
  - extend server routes, public API formatting, image proxy, and UI tests for Dispatcharr cases

## Where The Fork Changes Code

Shared contracts:

- `packages/shared/src/schemas.ts` adds `dispatcharr` to server type validation and extends server create/update schemas with Dispatcharr credentials/settings.
- `packages/shared/src/types.ts` extends server-related types with `dispatcharr`, `dispatcharrAuthMode`, and `ignoreAnonymousStreams`.
- `packages/shared/src/constants.ts` adds Dispatcharr brand color support.

Database:

- `apps/server/src/db/schema.ts` extends `serverTypeEnum` and adds the Dispatcharr server column:
  - `ignore_anonymous_streams boolean default true not null`
- It also adds Dispatcharr playback metadata to `sessions`:
  - `dispatcharr_playback_kind varchar(20)`
  - `progress_estimated boolean default false not null`
- `apps/server/src/db/migrations/` is the upstream-only migration history. It must remain directly mergeable with the source repository.
- `apps/server/src/db/fork-migrations/` is the Dispatcharr overlay, with its own `meta/_journal.json` and `tracearr_fork.__drizzle_migrations` database ledger. Its current files `0000`–`0005` replace the historical main-ledger migrations `0067`–`0069`; `0004` removes the retired Dispatcharr live-history column and `0005` adds full User-Agent storage for device identity.
- Before upstream migrations, the runtime removes the exact legacy `0069_steady_squadron_supreme` ledger entry only when `media` is absent. This is a one-time compatibility bridge: its timestamp would otherwise cause Drizzle to skip upstream `0067_cold_maggott`, which creates `media`.
- The overlay runs after upstream migrations. Its SQL is idempotent so installations that previously ran `0067`–`0069`, installations where they were skipped, and original Tracearr databases all converge without data loss.

Server-side Dispatcharr integration:

- `apps/server/src/services/mediaServer/dispatcharr/client.ts` implements the Dispatcharr media server client.
- `apps/server/src/services/mediaServer/dispatcharr/parser.ts` normalizes Dispatcharr status, user, Live TV, VOD, codec, profile, programme, and image data into Tracearr session shapes.
- `apps/server/src/services/mediaServer/dispatcharr/realtime.ts` implements Dispatcharr WebSocket handling with REST bootstrap/fallback behavior, including `timeshift_stats` catch-up updates and periodic EPG refresh.
- `apps/server/src/services/mediaServer/index.ts` registers `DispatcharrClient` in the media server factory.
- `apps/server/src/services/mediaServer/types.ts` carries Dispatcharr-specific config through the generic media server interface.

Server routes and services:

- `apps/server/src/routes/servers.ts` accepts Dispatcharr credentials/settings, verifies connections, stores encoded username/password credentials when token auth is not used, and returns Dispatcharr settings.
- `apps/server/src/services/sync.ts` syncs Dispatcharr users through the generic user sync path.
- `apps/server/src/services/termination.ts` passes Dispatcharr config into session termination.
- `apps/server/src/services/imageProxy.ts` normalizes Dispatcharr image paths, supports Dispatcharr channel logos, and uses `inside` resize fit for Dispatcharr images.
- Dispatcharr channel-logo proxy requests must use the configured server origin
  and an empty header set. Do not reintroduce generic `Accept` or auth headers
  when refactoring the shared image-proxy request builder; preserve URL
  normalization and `fit: inside` while retaining upstream cache/LQIP behavior
  for other server types.
- Uncropped Dashboard artwork is a permanent, intentional fork behavior,
  not a temporary workaround:
  preserve it when merging upstream image-proxy or Dashboard changes.
  Dashboard artwork reserves the normal poster slot, but an inner visual
  element takes the image's actual bounded aspect ratio. Shared
  poster cache entries preserve the full image with Sharp `fit: inside` for
  every provider; avatars/art retain their prior sizing behavior. Jellyfin/Emby
  thumbnails constrain both dimensions, while Plex posters use the source
  image to avoid fill-transcoder cropping, including background warming.
  Background warming suppresses the retry while preserving these request shapes.
  Cache keys are unchanged. The cache directory follows `IMAGE_CACHE_DIR`, with
  `/data/tracearr/image-cache` in Docker images and the original working-directory
  `data/image-cache` fallback elsewhere. Startup removes recognized cached WebP files once, before
  serving requests, then writes `.uncropped-artwork-v1` in the image-cache
  directory. Later starts retain the regenerated files. Dashboard URLs append
  `artwork=2` only to refresh browser caches; this is not a server cache variant.
  The artwork container is transparent when an image exists, exposing the
  card's blurred backdrop in letterbox/pillarbox space; it keeps `bg-muted`
  only for the missing-image server-icon placeholder. The shadow and hover
  dimmer belong to that inner visual element, never to the fixed poster slot.
  The `32px` Play/Pause icon is `shrink-0` and may extend past an extremely
  small image, so it must never be clipped by the artwork container.
  Validated with Node 24 / pnpm 12.3.4: services (3,347 passed, one skipped),
  web (1,224 passed with two workers), typecheck, lint (754 warnings, unchanged),
  and build. Docker and live-provider manual smoke checks were not run.
- `apps/server/src/routes/public.ts` and `apps/server/src/routes/public.openapi.ts` expose Dispatcharr-aware live media fields in public API responses.
- Dashboard daily stats keep `todayPlays`, `todaySessions`, and `watchTimeHours` as VOD-only metrics, add `tvSessions`, `tvChannels`, and `tvWatchTimeHours` for `mediaType === 'live'`, and count `activeUsersToday` across all media types so Dispatcharr Live TV/catch-up activity is no longer invisible on the homepage.
- Dispatcharr Server Resources are supplied by the separate `Dispatcharr-Metrics` v1 plugin. The plugin broadcasts sanitized `tracearr_server_stats` schema version `1` messages on the existing authenticated `updates` WebSocket; Tracearr accepts only finite timestamps and 0–100 utilization values. `process*` samples describe the complete Docker `web` container cgroup (including FFmpeg and cache-backed memory), not the host. If Docker has no explicit memory limit, the container memory percentage uses host-visible `MemTotal` as denominator, matching Docker Stats' no-limit behavior. `host*` samples are true host-wide CPU and memory utilization via Dispatcharr's bundled `psutil`, constrained to `0.00–100.00%`; they include every process visible to the host. The same plugin publishes `tracearr_bandwidth_stats` schema version `1` aggregate one-second samples (`lanBytes` and `wanBytes`) for the dashboard Bandwidth card; Tracearr retains 156 samples. A zero-valued sample is valid and shows the card; missing or invalid fields do not. Username/password authentication is required to keep the Dispatcharr WebSocket; API-key mode remains REST-only and has no resource or bandwidth samples. v1 supports Docker AIO and modular `web` deployments only; bare-metal/systemd is intentionally unsupported.
- The same plugin broadcasts `tracearr_plugin_info` schema version `1` on the authenticated `updates` WebSocket, with `pluginId: tracearr-sse-metrics`, name, and the runtime version from `plugin.json`. Dispatcharr realtime status treats a valid message as the active plugin/version signal and reports `pluginIssue: missing` when a connected WebSocket receives no such message within the detection grace period. This is active-plugin detection, not proof that disabled plugin files exist on disk.
- Plugin update checks use separate version families: Jellyfin/Emby continue using the configured SSE manifest, while Dispatcharr-Metrics uses the latest stable GitHub release from `d4rk-4lchemy/Tracearr-SSE-Metrics`. GitHub `vX.Y.Z` tags are normalized before comparison, and a failure in one source does not suppress checks for the other family.
- Activity stats (`plays`, `concurrent`, day/hour activity, platforms, quality, users, and top users) include `movie`, `episode`, and `live` sessions from every supported server type. The two-minute intentional-play threshold remains limited to the plays/activity charts; Dashboard, engagement, and other primary-statistics filters remain VOD-only.
- `apps/server/src/routes/sessions.ts` carries `dispatcharrPlaybackKind` through `/sessions/history` so History UI can distinguish Dispatcharr catch-up/timeshift rows from ordinary Live TV.

Realtime and polling:

- `apps/server/src/services/sseManager.ts` manages Dispatcharr WebSocket connectors in addition to Plex/Jellyfin/Emby SSE.
- `apps/server/src/jobs/dispatcharrRealtimeProcessor.ts` consumes healthy Dispatcharr WebSocket snapshots directly, updates the active-session cache, and publishes existing `session:started`, `session:updated`, and `session:stopped` events.
- `apps/server/src/index.ts` starts and stops the Dispatcharr realtime processor with other background services.
- `apps/server/src/jobs/poller/processor.ts` skips normal Dispatcharr session processing while WebSocket mode is healthy. Dispatcharr polling remains the fallback for API-key/token mode, disconnected/fallback WebSocket mode, and explicit reconciliation after realtime loss.
- Dispatcharr Live TV, VOD, and catch-up history confirmation uses the shared playback lifecycle and global confirmation threshold. Pending REST/WebSocket snapshots replace metadata in place while protecting maximum progress from partial/out-of-order data.
- Authoritative Dispatcharr stop results retain the exact active-session ID
  through pending/database stop, cache removal, pub/sub, and notifications, so
  catch-up clients sharing a provider session key cannot stop one another.
- Dispatcharr catch-up/timeshift sessions are also keyed to `media.type === 'live'`, but carry `dispatcharrPlaybackKind === 'catchup'` and `progressEstimated === true`. Catch-up uses `/proxy/stats/` plus `/proxy/catchup/programs/` for enrichment. Programme title and EPG timeline update in place like Dispatcharr Live TV; the resolved programme must not be part of catch-up session identity.
- `apps/server/src/jobs/poller/stateTracker.ts` supports a configurable confirmation threshold and detects media-title changes for DB writes.
- `apps/server/src/jobs/poller/types.ts` extends poller server/session types to include Dispatcharr.

Web UI:

- `apps/web/src/components/settings/servers/` contains the Dispatcharr overlay
  on upstream's split settings UI: `Connections.tsx` creates servers,
  `AddServerDialog.tsx` and `EditServerDialog.tsx` use `DispatcharrFields.tsx`
  for auth modes and anonymous filtering, and `RealtimeSetupDialog.tsx`
  provides Metrics plugin and legacy-token migration guidance.
- `apps/web/src/components/icons/MediaServerIcon.tsx` and `apps/web/public/images/servers/dispatcharr.png` add Dispatcharr branding.
- `apps/web/src/components/sessions/NowPlayingCard.tsx` shows Live TV channel/programme-oriented cards.
- Catch-up cards must continue to use the Live TV visual grouping, but favor progress/remaining-time presentation over FFmpeg live-speed presentation.
- `apps/web/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx` now renders six daily stat cards in this order: Alerts, VOD Plays, VOD Watch Time, TV Sessions, TV Watch Time, Active Users.
- `apps/web/src/components/history/HistoryTable.tsx` fixes column sizing/truncation for long Live TV content, improves history layout, and shows the Dispatcharr catch-up indicator for catch-up rows.
- `apps/web/src/components/history/StreamDetailsPanel.tsx` shows FFmpeg speed and Dispatcharr-oriented stream details.
- `apps/web/src/lib/api.ts`, `apps/web/src/hooks/queries/useServers.ts`, and `apps/web/src/hooks/useServer.tsx` carry Dispatcharr server settings through the frontend API/cache layer.
- `apps/web/src/components/charts/ServerResourceCharts.tsx` temporarily owns the
  live-data lifecycle for Server Resources only while a legend entry is
  hidden. With every series visible, it uses the ordinary upstream
  HighchartsReact update flow. While hidden, samples for that series are held
  outside Highcharts and applied when its native legend entry shows it again,
  avoiding Highcharts 13's crashing hidden-point destruction path.
  This is only a stopgap: when upstream Tracearr fixes the chart lifecycle,
  its implementation must overwrite and remove this fork-owned code and tests
  during the merge; do not retain parallel chart lifecycle code.
- `SERVER_STATS_CONFIG.DATA_POINTS` is temporarily `21`: a two-minute range at
  six-second cadence has 20 intervals and therefore needs both endpoint
  samples. If upstream changes the Server Resources window model, adopt its
  implementation and remove this fork-specific endpoint correction.

Mobile UI:

- `apps/mobile/src/lib/mediaConfig.ts` and `apps/mobile/app/session/[id].tsx` add Dispatcharr label/color metadata.
- `apps/mobile/src/components/sessions/NowPlayingCard.tsx` displays Live TV as channel plus programme instead of generic media title.
- `apps/mobile/src/components/history/HistoryRow.tsx` fixes Live TV history content labels and shows the Dispatcharr catch-up indicator for catch-up rows.
- `apps/mobile/src/hooks/useImageUrl.ts` accepts absolute image URLs for Dispatcharr images.

Tests:

- Dispatcharr server tests live mainly under `apps/server/src/services/mediaServer/__tests__/dispatcharr-*.test.ts`.
- Supporting tests cover public API formatting, image proxy behavior, server routes/settings including Dispatcharr auth-mode edits, poller pending progress, web server selector/settings, Now Playing, history table, and stream details.

## Why These Changes Exist

Dispatcharr differs from the original supported media servers in several ways:

- Live TV state comes from Dispatcharr transport-stream status endpoints and can be enriched with channel/logo/current-programme APIs.
- VOD state can be included in Dispatcharr realtime snapshots and follows the same global pending confirmation lifecycle as Live TV.
- Catch-up state arrives from `/proxy/stats/` and `timeshift_stats`, while EPG enrichment comes from `/proxy/catchup/programs/`; both sources are required to keep programme titles, boundaries, and estimated progress current without splitting a single catch-up viewing session.
- WebSocket auth needs a JWT, while API keys can still support REST polling.
- Catch-up playhead is approximate: Dispatcharr reports anchors such as `programme_start`, `position_anchor_at`, and optional `playback_base_secs`, not a guaranteed client-authoritative position.
- Dispatcharr can report anonymous clients; the fork defaults to ignoring them to reduce noise.
- Session identifiers and termination endpoints differ between live and VOD streams.

## Future Upstream Update Notes

When merging or rebasing on source `main`, preserve the Dispatcharr overlay deliberately instead of treating it as incidental drift.

### Latest upstream merge

- Upstream `main` at `86db792d` was merged into `develop` on September 23,
  2026. It adds dated server locations, a local/remote classification for
  sessions, a location backfill job, local badges and History filters, and
  location editing in server settings. The upstream `0107` migration and
  snapshot are preserved byte-for-byte in the upstream migration history;
  the Dispatcharr fork migration ledger is unchanged. Poller changes combine
  upstream location placement with the fork's Dispatcharr realtime/polling
  lifecycle. The Dashboard card retains uncropped artwork and Catch-up
  presentation alongside the new local badge. The server editor keeps
  Dispatcharr token/credentials and anonymous-stream settings while adding
  location editing, with a regression test for saving both together.
  Fork-only History and Now Playing fixtures now provide the required
  `isLocal` field. The two-workflow policy remains intact. Full non-Docker CI
  passed with Node 24 / pnpm 12.4.2: lint, typecheck, translations, all five
  server test groups, web, coverage and build. Server groups plus web passed
  9,005 tests with two skipped; coverage passed 5,782 with two skipped
  (70.36% statements, 64.23% branches, 74.54% functions, 71.59% lines).
  The first typecheck caught the two fork-only fixtures; after repair the full
  typecheck passed. Lint has 753 warnings, one more than the preceding run,
  from upstream `LocationPicker.tsx` accessing a ref during render. Services
  and coverage each logged one extra instance of an existing warning class;
  the other job warning counts match the prior baseline. Logs and counts are
  in `.tmp/github-ci-warning-reference.md`. Docker integration, E2E, image
  builds, database upgrades and live-provider checks were omitted at the
  user's request.

- Upstream `main` at `ae9b34fe` was merged into `develop` on September 23,
  2026. It adds persistent image-cache configuration, adaptive background
  warming, cache estimates and sweep diagnostics; duplicate-file existence
  checks; recently updated library shelves and newsletter corrections;
  stream metadata in automation conditions/notifications; configurable email
  system titles; active-stream counts in the browser title; device hover text;
  import aggregate refreshes, dependency updates, translations and 2.5.0 notes.
  Image-proxy conflicts combine upstream's single-attempt warm requests with
  the fork's normalized Dispatcharr paths and uncropped poster requests.
  Dashboard conflicts retain all artwork/Catch-up behavior and add device
  hover text, with both upstream and fork regression coverage. Locale conflicts
  retain upstream translations and the fork's English key delta. Only PR CI
  remains; removed workflows and Vouch metadata stay removed. Upstream and
  fork migration histories are unchanged. Dispatcharr auth, leader-owned
  realtime, session lifecycle, library exclusions and two-channel versions
  remain intact. CI now selects Node 24 / pnpm 12.4.2; local instructions and
  both Docker images' explicit pnpm installations match that version.
  Full non-Docker CI passed on the first run with Node 24.21.0 / pnpm 12.4.2,
  `HUSKY=0` and a 4 GB heap after moving Turbo's cache aside and a frozen
  install: lint, typecheck, translations, unit/services/routes/auth/security,
  web, coverage and build. Server groups plus web passed 8,922 tests with two
  skipped; shared passed another 384. Coverage passed 5,729 with two skipped
  (70.27% statements, 64.10% branches, 74.78% functions, 71.49% lines).
  Lint has 752 warnings, down from 753; the removed warning is the upstream
  DuplicatesTable accessibility diagnostic, and Oxlint rewords an existing IP
  utility diagnostic. Services and coverage each add two occurrences of
  existing warning classes; all other warning counts/classes are unchanged.
  Logs use `.tmp/github-ci-<job>-20260923.log`; the runner exits zero.
  Validation results are recorded in `.tmp/github-ci-warning-reference.md`.
  Docker integration, E2E and image builds are omitted at the user's request;
  live-provider manual smoke tests and database upgrades are not exercised.

- Upstream `main` at `7ad41635` (Tracearr 2.4.1) was merged into `develop`
  on September 20, 2026 without textual conflicts. It adds state-aware iOS
  widget wake pushes and their distributed rate limiting, restores Seerr
  requests to landed status when approved media is available, updates map
  basemap styling, Helm metadata, shared release/version constants, and the
  2.4.1 release notes. The merge retains the Dispatcharr-only server type
  color and cache keys, leader-gated Dispatcharr realtime lifecycle and
  fork-migration wiring in startup, the request-service exclusion of
  Dispatcharr from Seerr/library behavior, uncropped Dashboard artwork, and
  the PR-only CI policy. Upstream migrations are unchanged and the separate
  Dispatcharr migration ledger is untouched.
  Full non-Docker CI passed with Node 24 / pnpm 12.3.4, `HUSKY=0`, and a 4 GB
  Node heap after moving the local Turbo cache aside and performing a frozen
  install: lint (753 known warnings), typecheck, translations,
  unit/services/routes/auth/security, web, coverage, and build. Web passed
  1,728 tests; coverage passed 5,665 with two skipped (69.53% statements,
  63.41% branches, 74.51% functions, 70.70% lines). Docker integration,
  E2E, image builds, database-upgrade checks, and live-provider manual smoke
  tests were intentionally omitted at the user's request.

- Upstream `main` at `19db484d` (Tracearr 2.4.0) was merged into `develop`
  on September 18, 2026. Jellystat uploads are spooled to disk rather than
  carried in Redis, and JSONL imports retain only consumed tables. Imported
  history keeps existing provider IDs when matched media lacks them. Shared
  playback-decision/trust helpers, server-statistics access checks, ISO user
  dates, mobile push/widget updates, map framing and job-progress fixes,
  automation version requirements, translations and release notes are retained.
  Conflicts preserve Dispatcharr channel/programme and Catch-up presentation,
  Live TV engagement-badge exclusion and fixed History column widths while
  adopting upstream's unknown-position behavior (no percentage/badge for null
  progress; measured zero remains 0%). History tests cover both overlays.
  Dashboard changes only relocate playback-decision imports; uncropped artwork,
  transparent slots, fixed Play/Pause controls and cache markers are intact.
  Dispatcharr auth/realtime/lifecycle, two-channel version API and fork CI/release
  policy remain unchanged. Upstream migration history is unchanged and identical
  to source; Dispatcharr migrations remain in their separate ledger.
  Full non-Docker CI passed with Node 24 / pnpm 12.3.4, `HUSKY=0` and a
  4 GB heap after clearing Turbo: frozen install, lint, typecheck, translations,
  unit/services/routes/auth/security, web, coverage and build. The first lint
  caught an unused conflict-resolution variable; the complete lint rerun passed.
  Server groups plus web passed 8,807 tests with two skipped; shared passed 374.
  Coverage passed 5,652 with two skipped (69.50% statements, 63.37% branches,
  74.45% functions, 70.67% lines). Lint decreased from 754 to 753 warnings
  because upstream map framing removes a non-null assertion. Other job warning
  counts and normalized classes are unchanged. Automated Dispatcharr regressions
  passed. Logs use `.tmp/github-ci-<job>-20260918-19db.log`, with `lint-final`
  for the successful lint rerun; details are in the local warning reference.
  Docker integration, E2E and image builds are omitted at the user's request;
  real-provider manual smoke checks are not covered by this local run.


- Upstream `main` at `b415b44e` was merged into `develop` on September 17,
  2026. It adds Plex GUID library identity, imported-history linking and manual
  duplicate cleanup, Jellystat JSONL/episode import improvements, tracking-time
  cutoffs and runtime bounds, container-identity unlinking, and hidden progress
  bars for sessions without a known duration. Migration `0106_smart_queen_noir`
  is retained unchanged in the upstream ledger; the Dispatcharr ledger remains
  separate. Server-route and library-sync conflicts combine upstream linking
  hooks with Dispatcharr auth and library-capability guards; test mocks retain
  both behaviors without duplicate SSE mocks. Duplicate cleanup explicitly
  skips Dispatcharr, whose session keys have no supported history-import
  format; a mixed-provider regression covers that boundary. Plex linking stays
  Plex-only. Dispatcharr realtime/lifecycle, uncropped Dashboard artwork and
  cache markers, two-channel version API and fork CI/release policy remain
  intact. The upstream 2.4.0 release-note source and privacy policy are retained.
  Full non-Docker CI passed with Node 24 / pnpm 12.3.4, `HUSKY=0` and a
  4 GB Node heap after clearing Turbo: frozen install, lint, typecheck,
  translations, unit/services/routes/auth/security, web, coverage and build.
  Initial typecheck and services failures exposed the cleanup provider boundary
  and queue mock mismatch above; all affected full jobs passed after repair.
  Server groups plus web passed 8,775 tests with two skipped; shared passed 361.
  Coverage passed 5,630 with two skipped (69.28% statements, 63.19% branches,
  74.25% functions, 70.43% lines). Lint decreased from 755 to 754 warnings;
  services/coverage each add three occurrences of existing warning classes.
  Logs use `.tmp/github-ci-<job>-20260917-b415.log`; successful reruns are
  `services-final`, `lint-recheck` and `typecheck-recheck`. See the local warning
  reference for details. Docker integration, E2E and image builds were omitted
  at the user's request; migration execution, database upgrade paths and
  live-provider manual smoke checks remain unverified.


- Upstream `main` at `89202893` was merged into `develop` on September 17,
  2026. Resolution classification now prioritizes pixels, with separate 8K,
  1440p and 480p library buckets, shared display casing and translated playback
  labels. Migration `0105_breezy_wind_dancer` is unchanged in the upstream
  ledger; aggregate schema version 16 adds the corresponding snapshot columns.
  The Dispatcharr migration ledger remains separate. The library-sync import
  conflict retains `supportsMediaLibrary()` and its Dispatcharr exclusion;
  the concurrent-chart conflict combines upstream translations with the fork's
  existing timestamp fallback. Dispatcharr session/catch-up presentation,
  History column widths, permanent uncropped artwork and both cache markers
  remain intact. Dockerfiles retain fork metadata and fork-migration copies
  while adopting upstream's npm installation of pnpm. Fork PR-only CI and
  manual-only releases are unchanged. Upstream privacy-policy updates are
  retained.
  Full non-Docker CI passed on its first run with Node 24 / pnpm 12.3.4,
  `HUSKY=0` and a 4 GB Node heap after clearing Turbo: frozen install, lint,
  typecheck, translations, unit/services/routes/auth/security, web, coverage
  and build. Server groups plus web passed 8,605 tests with two skipped;
  shared passed another 360. Coverage passed 5,468 with two skipped
  (66.85% statements, 61.01% branches, 72.83% functions, 67.93% lines).
  Lint retains 755 warnings; all jobs retain September 15 warning counts and
  normalized message classes. Automated Dispatcharr auth/settings, lifecycle,
  images and termination coverage passed. Details are recorded in
  `.tmp/github-ci-warning-reference.md`; logs use
  `.tmp/github-ci-<job>-20260917-8920.log`. Docker integration,
  E2E and image builds are omitted at the user's request, so migration execution
  and database upgrade paths are not validated by this run. Live-provider
  Dispatcharr manual smoke checks are not covered by this local run.

- Upstream `main` at `452cef79` (Tracearr 2.3.0) was merged into `develop`
  on September 15, 2026. It adds bundled release notes, the owner's What's New
  dialog, reopening notes from the sidebar, and upgrade warnings downloaded
  from release assets. Shared semantic-version helpers replace the old queue
  implementation; fork `vX.Y.Z-rN` comparison remains separate.
  The version API retains `fork`, `upstream`, and `recommended`; both latest
  payloads now include `upgradeWarnings`. Fork warnings are bounded by the
  target fork's upstream base, so a newer upstream release does not put its
  warnings on an older fork update. Old cached releases default to an empty
  warning list, and the route removes warnings for already-installed versions.
  What's New reads the installed upstream version and `upstream.latest`;
  fork update badges, image repository, release URLs, cooldown, and fresh
  startup-job IDs remain intact. Crowdin changes retain intentional fork keys.
  The manual release workflow now validates and renders bundled release notes
  and attaches `release-notes.json`; it remains manual-only with the Helm push
  job disabled. PR CI structure and toolchain are unchanged. Upstream migrations,
  the separate Dispatcharr migration ledger, auth/realtime/session behavior,
  and permanent uncropped artwork/cache markers are unchanged.
  Full non-Docker CI passed on its first run with Node 24 / pnpm 12.3.4,
  `HUSKY=0`, and a 4 GB Node heap after clearing Turbo: frozen install,
  lint, typecheck, translations, unit/services/routes/auth/security, web,
  coverage and build. Server groups plus web passed 8,603 tests with two
  skipped; the separate shared suite passed 360. Coverage passed 5,463 with
  two skipped (66.86% statements, 61.01% branches, 72.90% functions,
  67.95% lines). The release-note renderer also passed for `v2.3.0`.
  Lint has 755 warnings; all jobs retain September 14 warning counts/classes.
  Logs use `.tmp/github-ci-<job>-20260915-452c.log`; the overall runner exits
  zero. Validation details are in `.tmp/github-ci-warning-reference.md`.
  Docker integration and E2E are omitted at the user's request; Docker image
  builds and live-provider manual smoke checks are not covered by this run.

- Upstream `main` at `9d2e17ab` was merged into `develop` on September 14,
  2026. Jellyfin/Emby API keys can now be edited, and Plex/Jellyfin/Emby URL
  or key changes must reach the saved server identity. Dispatcharr does not
  expose `getServerIdentity`, so its URL and credential edits retain the
  existing admin-access verification without the unsupported identity check.
  The generic `apiKey` field is rejected for Dispatcharr; its token and complete
  username/password modes remain separate in the schema, route, hooks and UI.
  All connector changes still reconcile on the Redis leader. Invalid
  Jellyfin/Emby keys return HTTP 400 rather than 401 in both connection routes
  and the fork's shared access helper, preserving the logged-in browser session.
  Crowdin locale order and the removal of redundant `en-US` are retained,
  applying only the intentional English fork key delta to upstream locales.
  Upstream removes translation `composite` mode to prevent stale declarations.
  The new form's missing `servers.apiKeyKeepCurrent` source string is supplied
  with empty non-English placeholders, restoring typed translation coverage.
  Requests navigation and dependency updates are retained; migrations,
  Dispatcharr lifecycle, uncropped artwork and fork CI/release policy are unchanged.
  Full non-Docker CI passed with Node 24 / pnpm 12.3.4 and a 4 GB Node heap:
  frozen install, lint, typecheck, translations, unit/services/routes/auth/
  security, web, coverage and build. Server groups plus web passed 8,599 tests
  with two skipped; coverage passed 5,491 with two skipped (66.87% statements,
  61.05% branches, 72.88% functions, 67.95% lines). Lint remains at 755 warnings;
  timestamp/PID-normalized warning classes match September 13 for every job.
  Initial lint/typecheck/routes failures exposed a duplicated test import and
  the missing translation above; all affected full jobs passed after repair.
  Logs use `.tmp/github-ci-<job>-20260914-9d2e.log`, with final dependency,
  lint/typecheck/translations/routes logs using `-final-` before the date.
  Docker integration and E2E were omitted at the user's request. Docker image
  builds and live-provider manual smoke checks were not performed; automated
  Dispatcharr auth/settings, lifecycle, images and termination coverage passed.

- Upstream `main` at `fc7a0603` was merged into `develop` on September 13,
  2026. This adds request analytics and requested-season watched lenses,
  newsletter recipient management, richer user merges and dismissed suggestions,
  and scheduled library-server user refresh. Migration `0104_numerous_miek`
  remains unchanged in the upstream ledger; the Dispatcharr ledger is separate.
  Auth conflicts adopt upstream cookie-based Jellyfin/Emby connection responses
  (`{ serverId }`) without issuing owner tokens. The retired token-in-query
  `/servers/:id/image/*` route stays removed; the shared image proxy, uncropped
  Dashboard artwork and both cache markers remain intact. Dispatcharr add/edit,
  credentials, leader-owned realtime, library and Seerr exclusions are preserved.
  Locale reconciliation uses upstream values and only the fork-owned English
  key delta, avoiding restoration of obsolete localized keys. The obsolete
  `_template` directory is removed as upstream now relies on Crowdin.
  Full non-Docker CI passed with Node 24 / pnpm 12.3.4: frozen install,
  lint, typecheck, translations, unit/services/routes/auth/security, web,
  coverage and build. Server groups plus web passed 8,592 tests with two
  skipped; coverage passed 5,485 with two skipped (66.87% statements,
  61.05% branches, 72.87% functions, 67.95% lines). Lint has 755 warnings,
  down from 766; runtime warnings remain in existing message classes.
  Logs use `.tmp/github-ci-<job>-20260913-fc7a.log`; the final locale check
  uses `translations-final`. Docker integration and E2E were omitted at the
  user's request. Docker builds and live-provider manual smoke checks were
  not performed.

- Upstream `main` at `03f3248a` was merged into `develop` on September 11,
  2026. This adds Seerr request tracking, per-server linking, media/user request
  panels, Plex genre refresh, Jellyfin 12 collection-aware library listings,
  removal confirmation, and the showcase capture tools. Upstream migration
  `0103_luxuriant_wolfpack` remains unchanged in the upstream ledger; the
  Dispatcharr overlay remains separate. Media-detail conflict resolution keeps
  `mediaLibraryServerIds` for every query, including the new requests query.
  Seerr server lookups and Connections exclude Dispatcharr, which has no media
  catalog or Seerr integration; Dispatcharr remains available for sessions,
  history, auth edits, and realtime. Focused regression tests cover the Seerr
  eligibility boundary and mixed-server media query scope. Ukrainian locales
  retain upstream translations and fork-owned keys. The showcase active-session
  fixture supplies the fork's `progressUpdatedAt` from its sampled `lastSeenAt`.
  Dashboard artwork/cache markers, Dispatcharr leader ownership, library-sync
  exclusions, and fork distribution policies remain intact. E2E dependency
  builds now include emails; `AGENTS.md` mirrors that upstream CI correction.
  Full non-Docker CI passed with Node 24 / pnpm 12.3.4: frozen install,
  lint, typecheck, translations, unit/services/routes/auth/security, web,
  coverage, and build. Server groups plus web passed 8,549 tests with two
  skipped; emails passed 49. Coverage passed 5,460 with two skipped
  (66.86% statements, 61.10% branches, 73.02% functions, 67.95% lines).
  Lint has 766 warnings (one above the previous merge); runtime diagnostics
  remain within existing message classes. Typecheck passed after supplying
  the missing showcase progress timestamp. Logs use
  `.tmp/github-ci-<job>-20260911-03f3.log`, with successful final lint and
  typecheck logs using `-final-` before the date. Docker integration and E2E are
  explicitly omitted at the user's request. Live-provider manual smoke checks
  and Docker image builds are not covered by this local run.

- Upstream `main` at `32c9d378` was merged into `develop` on September 10,
  2026 (merge commit `f97efbcb`). This adds newsletters/email destinations, the emails workspace package,
  split settings components, public Jellyfin/Emby addresses, Emby connection
  diagnostics, library-name sanitization, and resilient Tautulli page imports.
  Upstream migrations `0097`–`0102` remain unchanged in the upstream ledger;
  Dispatcharr migrations remain separate and are still copied into both images.
  Conflicts were reconciled by porting Dispatcharr creation, auth edits,
  anonymous filtering, and Metrics setup onto the new settings components and
  combining public URL updates with the fork's server-access validation.
  Localized JSON was merged by key, retaining fork labels and upstream values.
  Dashboard uncropped artwork, image-cache markers, leader-owned realtime, and
  Dispatcharr library exclusions remain intact. CI remains PR-only with no
  integration matrix, and release remains manual with the Helm push job disabled.
  Build shared, emails, and test-utils before server validation; local command
  instructions were updated. Full non-Docker CI passed with Node 24 and
  pnpm 12.3.4: frozen install, lint, typecheck, translations, all five server
  groups, web, coverage, and build. Server groups plus web passed 8,359 tests
  with two skipped; emails passed another 49. Coverage passed 5,365 tests with
  two skipped (66.62% statements, 60.83% branches, 72.91% functions, 67.69% lines).
  Lint has 765 warnings (up from 754); new upstream settings/newsletter
  diagnostics and existing warning classes are recorded in the warning reference.
  Local stale incremental translation declarations required forced TypeScript
  regeneration and replacement of the Turbo build artifact before typecheck
  passed. Logs use `.tmp/github-ci-<job>-20260910-32c9.log`; final lint and
  typecheck logs include `-final-` before the date.
  Docker integration, E2E, and Docker builds are omitted at the user's request.
  Live-provider Dispatcharr manual smoke checks were not performed; automated
  add/edit, auth, realtime/lifecycle, image and termination coverage passed.

- Upstream `main` at `28b8c344` was merged into `develop` on September 10,
  2026 without textual conflicts. The watched-media API now scopes all results
  by `user_id`, removes `window` and `watched_state_user`, includes episode
  numbering scoped by server, and pages a bounded Redis-cached candidate list.
  React, MapLibre, undici, Expo server SDK, jsdom, and image digests were updated.
  The toolchain is now Node 24 / pnpm 12.3.4, as selected by CI through the root
  `packageManager`; current local validation commands in `AGENTS.md` and
  `MERGE_INSTRUCTION.md` were updated accordingly. No migrations changed.
  Dispatcharr API types, library exclusions, and fork distribution policies
  remain intact. Docker integration and E2E are omitted at the user's request.
  Full non-Docker CI passed: install, lint, typecheck, translations, all five
  server groups, web, coverage, and build. The group/web jobs passed 7,687 tests
  with two skipped; coverage passed 5,068 with two skipped (65.34% statements,
  59.87% branches, 72.44% functions, 66.39% lines). Lint reported 756 warnings
  before rebuilding shared and 754 afterwards (two new upstream non-null
  assertions); other warning counts match September 9. Logs use
  `.tmp/github-ci-<job>-20260910.log`, with the final lint result in
  `.tmp/github-ci-lint-after-build-20260910.log`. Live Dispatcharr manual smoke
  checks and Docker image builds were not performed.

- Upstream `main` at `877c7f8a` was merged into `develop` on September 9,
  2026. The merge adds the public API v2 watched-media endpoint, two-part
  server-version normalization, shared table spacing improvements, Helm and
  Compose port configuration fixes, dependency updates, and Crowdin translations.
  Locale conflicts were reconciled by key, retaining fork-only labels while
  accepting updated upstream translations. The Snyk modify/delete conflict
  retains the fork's removal; PR-only CI, removed Renovate/Stale workflows, and manual-only
  releases with the Helm push job disabled remain intact. No migrations changed.
  Dispatcharr library-sync exclusions and API server types remain intact, and
  History retains its fixed column widths and mobile minimum table width.
  Full non-Docker CI passed with Node 24 and pnpm 11.11.0: lint (752 warnings,
  unchanged), typecheck, translations, unit/services/routes/auth/security,
  web, coverage, and build. The individual test jobs passed 7,677 tests with
  two skipped; the separate coverage run passed 5,063 tests with two skipped
  (65.46% statements, 59.93% branches, 72.65% functions, 66.50% lines).
  No live Dispatcharr instance was exercised in this local validation.
  Docker-backed integration and E2E validation are explicitly omitted at the
  user's request for this merge.

- Upstream `main` at `5c7912a1` was merged into `develop` on September 3,
  2026 (merge commit `a20477e3`). The merge retains upstream migrations
  `0095` and `0096` in the upstream ledger while preserving the separate
  Dispatcharr fork-migration ledger. It also carries upstream's TypeScript 7 /
  Oxlint transition, `session.first_seen` automation trigger, map and browser
  recovery improvements, user-merge hardening, dependency updates, and Crowdin
  translations. Dispatcharr realtime processing remains leader-gated, its
  polling/library exclusions remain in place, and the progress hook keeps its
  server timestamp anchoring while using the upstream fallback anchor for
  sessions that do not provide one.

- Upstream `main` at `7066c7a9` (Tracearr `v2.2.2`) was merged into
  `develop` on August 28, 2026 (merge commit `f9552a54`). The web automation
  builder now falls back to an RFC 4122 v4 UUID generated with
  `crypto.getRandomValues()` when a plain-HTTP LAN origin lacks
  `crypto.randomUUID`; the reducer regression coverage came with it. The
  supervised Docker image already contained the upstream basemap update, and
  the Helm chart version was advanced to 2.2.2. No migrations or
  Dispatcharr-specific control paths changed. Fork CI remains PR-only,
  Renovate/Stale workflows remain removed, and release automation remains manual-only with
  the Helm-chart push job disabled.

- Upstream `main` at `64401f0c` (Tracearr `v2.2.0`) was merged into
  `feature/prepare-for-2.2.0` on August 27, 2026. The built-in MapLibre/PMTiles
  map, richer media-added and media-upgraded notifications, Fastify 5.12.1,
  translation refresh, and release/Helm maintenance were retained. The merge
  added no upstream migrations. Translation conflicts were resolved with the
  refreshed upstream locales as the baseline and the fork's channel-count,
  VOD/TV dashboard, no-library, and upstream-version keys restored as English
  fallbacks in every locale. Dispatcharr remains excluded from media-library
  synchronization while retaining session, history, realtime, resource, and
  dashboard support; the fork's PR-only CI and manual-only release policy also
  remain intact. The upstream Helm-chart push job was subsequently disabled in
  the fork so it cannot use a release PAT to write directly to `main`.

- Upstream `main` at `6fc80e54` was merged into `feature/prepare-for-2.2.0`
  on August 20, 2026. The upstream `0089_zippy_frank_castle` migration,
  user identity rollups, server-list filtering, dashboard/navigation refresh,
  dependency/toolchain updates, and translation refresh were retained.
  Dispatcharr remains present in shared server contracts and settings; its
  fork migrations remain in the separate `fork-migrations` ledger. The History
  table now uses upstream's data-table structure while preserving Dispatcharr
  Live TV labels and the catch-up indicator. A post-`develop` shared-session
  mapper refactor had dropped Catch-up classification between `ProcessedSession`,
  active/pending cache entries, and session persistence; the fork restores
  `dispatcharrPlaybackKind` and active-card EPG fields across those boundaries.

- Upstream `main` at `bf662a89` was merged into `feature/prepare-for-2.2.0`
  on August 18, 2026. The upstream Plex re-authentication/token-reconciliation
  flow, dependency updates, Docker image refreshes, and translation fallbacks
  were retained. The `sseManager` conflict preserves the fork's leader-owned
  Dispatcharr-aware configuration comparison (type, name, normalized URL,
  token, and anonymous-stream setting), so it still replaces stale connectors
  after edits. GitHub Actions retain fork policy: CI is PR-only,
  Renovate/Stale workflows are removed, release is manual-only, and the integration matrix remains a
  manual validation path; upstream action/image pin updates were accepted.

- Upstream `main` at `da2828d1` was merged into `feature/prepare-for-2.2.0`
  on August 17, 2026. Upstream migration `0088`, the destinations-based
  notification system, and the rule lifecycle changes were retained.
  Dispatcharr continues to be included in the shared server and rule types;
  its WebSocket processor remains leader-lease owned, and authoritative stops
  retain the exact active-session ID through cache and notification handling.
  Upstream removed the mobile application, so the former mobile Dispatcharr
  presentation overlay was removed with it.

- Upstream `main` at `22199d26` (Tracearr `v2.1.0-beta.8`) was merged into
  `feature/prepare-for-2.1.0` on Friday, August 14, 2026 (merge commit
  `7b7e79e7`). Upstream security hardening, queue/Redis cleanup, media-detail
  replacement history, and migrations `0086`–`0087` were retained. Conflicts
  in the session cache and image proxy were reconciled: Redis active sessions
  still hydrate date fields for Dispatcharr lifecycle operations, while all
  image requests now receive upstream origin/SSRF validation; Dispatcharr
  retains normalized image paths, no added channel-logo headers, and
  `fit: inside` resizing.
- The upstream locale refresh omitted keys used by the fork's VOD/TV dashboard
  and update-status UI. The translation checker was run with `--fix`, adding
  the English fallback values to all locale files, after which the full
  translation check passed.

- Upstream `main` at `73e00663` (Tracearr `v2.1.0-beta.7`) was merged into
  `feature/prepare-for-2.1.0` on Tuesday, August 11, 2026. The upstream
  server-identity backfill, media-server deep links, login-role hardening,
  and scoped server listing were retained. Dispatcharr remains a first-class
  server type: its credentials/settings are returned only through the
  Dispatcharr-aware route formatting, it participates in identity backfill,
  and library sync stays guarded by `supportsMediaLibrary()`.
- Upstream Crowdin locale updates and package/workspace changes were retained.
  Future locale updates should continue to use upstream as the baseline;
  Dispatcharr UI labels are implemented in the server settings components and
  must be smoke-tested after translation changes.

- Upstream `main` at `36d82db5` was merged into
  `feature/prepare-for-2.1.0` on Monday, August 10, 2026 (merge commit
  `a1595115`). The upstream live-statistics time-window implementation was
  retained across server, mobile, shared contracts, and web charts.
- The temporary fork-only Highcharts hidden-series lifecycle workaround was
  removed as required: upstream now owns the chart update lifecycle. Its
  time-window model also supersedes the fork's 21-point endpoint correction;
  `SERVER_STATS_CONFIG` now uses the upstream time-bound retention settings.
- Dispatcharr server-resource samples continue to use the same generic
  `ServerResourceDataPoint` path, so no Dispatcharr-specific chart control
  flow was retained.

General merge rules:

- Prefer upstream as the baseline for auth hardening, security fixes, dependency/toolchain updates, generic SSE robustness, and identity/user model changes.
- Prefer the fork for Dispatcharr-specific capabilities, but port them onto the upstream structure instead of keeping older fork control flow wholesale.
- Do not resolve high-risk conflicts by taking the entire fork file or entire upstream file in:
  - shared server schemas/types
  - `apps/server/src/routes/servers.ts`
  - `apps/server/src/services/sseManager.ts`
  - `apps/server/src/jobs/poller/processor.ts`
  - Dispatcharr web/mobile settings and status UI
- Reconcile schema intent first, then regenerate migrations and lockfile artifacts afterwards.
- If a commit is labeled as lint/typecheck cleanup, still inspect it for hidden behavioral overlap before replaying it after a merge. Some recent CI-cleanup commits also touched active Dispatcharr integration points.

High-conflict areas to review manually:

- `apps/server/src/services/imageProxy.ts`, `imageCacheMigration.ts`, startup
  wiring in `apps/server/src/index.ts`, and web `NowPlayingCard.tsx`: preserve
  full poster images for all providers, the shared cache, the one-time cleanup
  marker, and the browser refresh marker. Do not restore upstream poster
  `cover` resizing or restore a fixed poster-shaped visual wrapper. Preserve the
  transparent artwork container for real images and the `bg-muted` missing-image
  placeholder, inner aspect-ratio-bound effects, and unclipped fixed-size
  Play/Pause control. Keep the existing
  image-proxy, cache-migration, and NowPlayingCard regression tests. An upstream

Current upstream merge notes:

- Upstream `main` at `2483fe68` (Tracearr `v2.1.0-beta.5`) was merged into
  `feature/prepare-for-2.1.0` on Monday, August 10, 2026 (merge commit
  `bf28c7df`). The upstream `0085_far_captain_universe` migration and
  `library_items(server_id, thumb_path)` index were retained, along with the
  short-lived image-proxy server-row cache. The Dispatcharr image overlay was
  verified after the automatic merge: absolute paths remain normalized to the
  configured server origin, channel-logo proxy requests use no added headers,
  and Dispatcharr images retain `fit: inside`.

- Upstream `main` at `d058577d` (Tracearr `v2.1.0-beta.4`) was merged into
  `feature/prepare-for-2.1.0` on Sunday, August 9, 2026 (merge commit
  `e3b84559`). The upstream migration lock, TimescaleDB drift/degradation
  checks, PostgreSQL 18 test volume layout, server-side image resizing,
  live-resource stats, and playback-reporting import work were retained.
  The guarded migration runner now applies the upstream history and the
  Dispatcharr fork overlay under the same advisory lock while retaining their
  separate ledgers and the legacy-ledger repair. Dispatcharr-specific image
  normalization and header-free channel-logo requests remain intact before
  the upstream resize/fallback candidates are built.

- Upstream `main` at `55af7da5` (Tracearr `v2.0.1`) was merged into
  `feature/better-live-tv-for-jellyfin-and-emby` on Thursday, August 7, 2026
  (merge commit `a28c0103`). The upstream full-scan and snapshot aggregation
  rewrite was retained. `LibrarySyncService.syncServer()` keeps the fork's
  `supportsMediaLibrary()` guard, so Dispatcharr remains excluded from library
  catalog work while retaining session/history and realtime support.
- Jellyfin/Emby SSE retains upstream's bounded event-burst debounce, plugin
  diagnostics, leader-only connection refresh, and library-event sync. The
  fork additionally carries immediate terminal-event polling; Dispatcharr
  continues to use its separate authenticated WebSocket snapshot processor.
- Session producers are leader-lease gated: the Redis lease holder runs the
  poller, Jellyfin/Emby SSE processor, plugin checker, and Dispatcharr
  realtime snapshot processor. On lease loss or shutdown they all stop before
  the lease is released, preventing duplicate polling or realtime consumers
  during failover.

- Upstream `main` at `c600f88f` was merged into `feature/version-2.0-preparation` on Wednesday, August 5, 2026 (merge commit `6a284d7a`). The merge retains the Dispatcharr library-capability guard: Dispatcharr remains excluded from library-sync scheduling and media catalog work while receiving session/history support.
- Upstream's Timescale maintenance, session-identity backfill, library-sync queue, import transaction, supervised Docker, and translation changes were retained. The database-client test conflict was resolved by retaining both the fork migration-ledger coverage and upstream raw-client error-listener coverage; the Dutch settings translation retains Dispatcharr configuration/realtime and fork-version keys alongside upstream localization updates.

- Upstream `main` at `367f6c69` has been merged into `feature/version-2.0-preparation` in the current working tree on Tuesday, August 4, 2026 (merge commit `0f7e1597`, followed by Dispatcharr reconciliation `368c460f`).
- The merge ports the Dispatcharr overlay onto Tracearr 2.0: the new media/version schema, public API v2, mobile navigation and SSE plugin recovery behavior are retained alongside Dispatcharr auth, polling/realtime snapshots, shared history-confirmation semantics, catch-up metadata, and image handling.
- Upstream migration history is now aligned through `0082_backfill_last_activity.sql`; the Dispatcharr overlay remains in its separate fork ledger.
- Migration `0063_long_maria_hill.sql` must keep upstream's login-username collision auto-rename block before creating `users_login_username_unique`; without it, `loginUsernameCollision.integration.test.ts` fails.
- Dispatcharr migrations now live in the separate fork overlay, leaving `apps/server/src/db/migrations/` aligned to upstream through `0066`.
- Local CI-equivalent validation for that merge used Node 24 and pnpm 11.11.0;
  use the current toolchain in `AGENTS.md` for subsequent validation.

### Migration History Policy

- Drizzle compares the latest `created_at` only within one ledger. The upstream and fork ledgers are intentionally separate so an original Tracearr database with newer upstream migrations still receives all missing Dispatcharr migrations.
- The pre-ledger Dispatcharr `0069_steady_squadron_supreme` entry remains a special upgrade case: before upstream migration, remove only its known hash/timestamp pair when `public.media` is missing. Do not generalize this to deleting arbitrary ledger rows.
- Keep upstream migration files and journal entries immutable and merge them from source as-is. Create fork schema changes only with `pnpm --filter @tracearr/server db:fork:generate -- <name>`; it creates a new overlay SQL file and monotonic journal entry.
- `db:generate` and `db:push` are deliberately disabled in this fork because the combined runtime schema would otherwise emit Dispatcharr DDL into the upstream history.
- Before releasing a migration-affecting merge, test a fresh database, an upgrade from the latest upstream release, and an upgrade from the prior fork release. Confirm `servers` rows survive, the fork ledger is populated, and all Dispatcharr columns exist.

Recommended merge workflow:

```bash
git fetch /tmp/Tracearr main:refs/remotes/source-tmp/main
git checkout develop
git checkout -b merge/upstream-main-2026-07-18
git merge source-tmp/main
pnpm install
pnpm test:unit
pnpm test:services
pnpm test:routes
pnpm test:security
```

For this environment, if global `pnpm` or Node is unavailable, use:

```bash
npx --yes -p node@24 -p pnpm@12.3.4 pnpm test:unit
```

## Minimum Dispatcharr Smoke Test After Merge

After an upstream merge that touched any server, auth, polling, realtime, or UI flow, do at least this minimum manual verification for Dispatcharr:

1. Add a new Dispatcharr server with token auth and verify it saves successfully.
2. Add or edit a Dispatcharr server with username/password auth and verify the server can switch into realtime-capable mode.
3. Open the server settings UI and confirm Dispatcharr-specific controls are still present:
   - auth mode handling
   - anonymous-stream filtering
   - shared global history-confirmation behavior
4. Verify a Dispatcharr Live TV session appears in active sessions.
5. Verify Dispatcharr VOD and catch-up use the shared history-confirmation lifecycle.
6. Confirm Dispatcharr channel/logo or image URLs still render through the current frontend/mobile image flow.
7. Confirm terminating a Dispatcharr session still works.
