  <b>This is AI slopped fork of Tracearr (https://github.com/connorgallopo/Tracearr), that allows tracking of Dispatcharr streams.</b><br/>
  <i>Do with it whatever you want, there is no guarantee it will work</i> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯<br/><br/>
  <i>Current vesrion:</i> <b>2.4.0</b>
</p>

> [!WARNING]  
> You can do "in-place" replacement of your current Tracearr instance.<br>But **CREATE A BACKUP FIRST**, as I don't guarantee 100% success rate, and **I don't care if you break your setup** ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

> [!NOTE]  
> If you want to have "Server Resources" charts populated for Dispatcharr in Tracearr, you need to install this Dispatcharr plugin and align your Docker Compose file according to its README: [Tracearr SSE Metrics](https://github.com/d4rk-4lchemy/Tracearr-SSE-Metrics)

> [!NOTE] 
> If you ever want to switch back from this fork to the official image, but you have already added a Dispatcharr server and stored data from its sessions, run the following command **while you are still using this forked image**.<br>`docker exec -it {distracearr_container_name} node apps/server/dist/scripts/purge-dispatcharr.js`<br>After running the command, you can stop this container and replace the image with the official one.

**What's New:**
- Support for Dispatcharr servers, with Login/Password (for WebSocket integration) or API Key auth,
- Shows currently running Live TV streams, as well as VOD Movies or VOD Shows,
- Allows you to discard streams from "Anonymous" user if you want,
- You can kill Dispatcharr streams directly from Tracearr dashboard,
- Live TV card is aligned to Dispatcharr needs, showing speed threshold, watchtime,
- Stream details for Live TV shows bitrate, codecs and video resolution,
- Support for Catch-Up (Timeshift) sessions, with small badge and custom card.

**Docker images:**
- `darkalchemy2137/distracearr:latest` - standalone Tracearr, so you also need to deploy `timescale` and `redis`
- `darkalchemy2137/distracearr:supervised` - supervised image

I tested it on **Supervised image**, so keep that in mind.
You can also build your own Docker image.<br>
Example docker build commands:
```bash
# Regular Image
docker build  -f docker/Dockerfile  -t distracearr-standalone  --build-arg APP_VERSION=2.4.0  --build-arg APP_TAG=2.4.0 --build-arg APP_UPSTREAM_VERSION=2.4.0 --build-arg APP_FORK_REVISION=1 --build-arg APP_FORK_VERSION=2.4.0-r1 --build-arg APP_COMMIT="$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)"  --build-arg APP_BUILD_DATE="$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)" .

# Supervised Image
docker build  -f docker/Dockerfile.supervised  -t distracearr  --build-arg APP_VERSION=2.4.0  --build-arg APP_TAG=supervised-2.4.0 --build-arg APP_UPSTREAM_VERSION=2.4.0 --build-arg APP_FORK_REVISION=1 --build-arg APP_FORK_VERSION=2.4.0-r1 --build-arg APP_COMMIT="$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)"  --build-arg APP_BUILD_DATE="$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)" .
```

Example `docker-compose.yml` for **Supervised** image:
```yaml
tracearr:
  image: darkalchemy2137/distracearr:supervised
  container_name: distracearr
  ports:

Tracearr is a monitoring platform for **Plex**, **Jellyfin**, and **Emby**. Track streams in real-time, dig into playback analytics, browse one catalog across every server, and spot account sharing before it gets out of hand.

Screenshots and the feature tour are at [tracearr.com](https://tracearr.com), the manual at [docs.tracearr.com](https://docs.tracearr.com). Both are updated with every release. This file is the short version.

## What It Does

**Multi-Server Dashboard** - Connect Plex, Jellyfin, and Emby to a single interface. Active streams, server health, and per-server CPU, memory, and bandwidth charts sit on one page. Plex reports its own numbers; Jellyfin and Emby report theirs through the [Tracearr SSE plugin](https://github.com/Tracearr/Media-Server-SSE).

**Session Tracking** - Complete session history: who watched what, when, where, and on what device. Every stream includes geolocation data with ASN, continent, and postal code.

**Stream Analytics** - See what's transcoding vs direct playing, track bandwidth usage, and see what people watch. Codec breakdowns, resolution stats, device compatibility scores.

**One Person, Many Accounts** - Someone with a Plex login and a Jellyfin login is one identity here. Merge duplicates by hand or take the suggestions, and split them again if you get it wrong. An identity's trust score is the worst of its active accounts, so merging never hides a problem.

**Media Catalog** - One record per title, matched across servers by IMDb, TMDB, or TVDB id, with each server's copies attached. Six pages sit under Media:

- **Overview** - Library stat cards, growth over time, recently added and most popular shelves, and a Dead Weight list of never-watched titles.
- **Browse** - A poster grid over the whole catalog, filtered by type, server, library, genre, resolution, dynamic range, watched state, year, or file size.
- **Genres** - Plays and watch time by genre, across every server in view.
- **Quality** - Resolution and codec distribution. Track how your 4K vs 1080p ratio changes.
- **Storage** - Usage predictions, duplicate detection across servers, stale content, and ROI analysis (watch hours per GB).
- **Watch** - Engagement metrics, completion rates, viewing patterns by hour and month, binge detection.

**Live TV & Music** - Track live TV sessions and music playback alongside movies and shows.

**Stream Map** - Where your streams come from, on a world map you host yourself. The vector basemap ships inside the container, so there are no tile keys and no requests to a third-party tile service.

**Automations** - A trigger fires, conditions decide whether it matters, actions run. Eighteen triggers cover sessions, accounts, library changes, server health, update availability, and newsletter results. Actions send a notification, adjust trust, message the client, or stop the stream, and an `if` action branches on conditions. Twenty-two templates ship built in, among them impossible travel, too many streams at once, simultaneous locations, device velocity, geo restrictions, account inactivity, no 4K transcodes, and stop paused streams. Any automation exports to a share code another instance can paste in.

**Trust Scores** - Every account starts at 100. Violations lower it, an automation can adjust, set, or reset it, and an identity's score is the lowest of its active accounts.

**Destinations** - Discord, generic JSON webhook, ntfy, Gotify, Apprise, Pushover, email over SMTP, mobile push, and a toast in the web UI.

**Newsletters** - Mail your members what was added: movies, shows with their new seasons, albums, and optionally what got watched most. Per server, on a daily, weekly, monthly, or cron schedule, with a window that picks up where the last email stopped. Addresses come from a contact email you set, their Tracearr login, or their Plex account. Every email carries an unsubscribe link and a view-in-browser link, and each send lands in a history tab with per-recipient status and retry.

**Public API** - Key-authenticated REST API for third-party integrations, v1 and v2. Generate a key under Settings, then read the [API reference](https://docs.tracearr.com/api) or the interactive Scalar page at `/api-docs` on your own instance.

**Bulk Actions** - Multi-select operations across tables. Acknowledge or dismiss violations in bulk, reset trust scores, delete session history.

**Data Import** - Bring history with you: Tautulli, a Jellystat backup file, or the Playback Reporting plugin read straight from Jellyfin or Emby.

## Why Tracearr?

Tautulli only works with Plex. Jellystat only works with Jellyfin and Emby. If you run multiple servers, you're stuck with multiple dashboards.

Tracearr handles all three. One install, one interface.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Download compose file
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/connorgallopo/Tracearr/main/docker/examples/docker-compose.pg18.yml

# Generate secrets
echo "JWT_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 32)" > .env
echo "COOKIE_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 32)" >> .env

# Deploy
docker compose -f docker-compose.pg18.yml up -d
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` and connect your Plex, Jellyfin, or Emby server.

**Unraid users:** The supervised image bundles the app, TimescaleDB, and Redis in one container and generates its own secrets on first boot. See [docker/examples](docker/examples/README.md) for details.

For Portainer deployment, alternative configurations, or detailed requirements, see the [Docker deployment guide](docker/examples/README.md). For full documentation, visit [docs.tracearr.com](https://docs.tracearr.com).

### Docker Tags

| Tag                  | Description                                        |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `latest`             | Stable release (requires external DB/Redis)        |
| `supervised`         | All-in-one stable release                          |
| `next`               | Latest prerelease (requires external DB/Redis)     |
| `supervised-next`    | All-in-one prerelease                              |

```bash
# All-in-one (easiest)
docker pull ghcr.io/connorgallopo/tracearr:supervised

# Stable (requires external services)
docker pull ghcr.io/connorgallopo/tracearr:latest

```

### Viewing Logs

**Standard Docker** - Each service runs in its own container:

```bash
docker logs tracearr          # Application logs
docker logs tracearr-postgres # Database logs
docker logs tracearr-redis    # Cache logs
```

**Supervised Docker** - All services run in one container. View logs in the web UI at `/debug` (Log Explorer section), or via CLI:

```bash
docker exec tracearr cat /var/log/supervisor/tracearr-error.log
```

Available log files: `tracearr.log`, `tracearr-error.log`, `postgres.log`, `postgres-error.log`, `redis.log`, `redis-error.log`, `supervisord.log`

Set `LOG_LEVEL=debug` for verbose output.

**Proxmox VE LXC** - Each service runs as a systemd unit:

```bash
journalctl -u tracearr   # Application logs
journalctl -u postgresql # Database logs
journalctl -u redis      # Cache logs
```

### Development Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies (requires pnpm 12+, Node.js 22.22.2+)
pnpm install

# Start database services
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
# Includes Mailpit for email testing: SMTP on 1025, inbox at http://localhost:8025

# Copy and configure environment
cp .env.example .env

# Run migrations
pnpm --filter @tracearr/server db:migrate

# Start dev servers
pnpm dev
```

Frontend runs at `localhost:5173`, API at `localhost:3000`.

**TimescaleDB** handles session history. Regular Postgres works for a few months, but long query histories kill performance. TimescaleDB is built for time-series data, so dashboard stats stay fast: they're pre-computed, not recalculated every page load.

**Fastify** over Express because it's measurably faster and schema validation catches bad requests before they hit handlers.

**MapLibre with a bundled PMTiles basemap** replaces the old raster tiles. The archive ships in the image, so the map works on an instance with no outbound internet access.

**SSE for instant sessions** - Plex streams session updates in real-time via Server-Sent Events, so streams appear the moment they start. Jellyfin and Emby get the same through the [Tracearr SSE plugin](https://github.com/Tracearr/Media-Server-SSE); without it they fall back to polling.

## Contributing

Every change starts as an issue or a [Discussion](https://github.com/connorgallopo/Tracearr/discussions) before any code is written. A maintainer labels it `planned` or `help wanted`, vouches for your account with `!vouch`, and only then does a pull request stay open. A PR with no agreed issue behind it is closed regardless of the code, and so is one from an unvouched account. Documentation-only fixes are the one exception to the discussion step.

AI tools are fine to use; you still have to be able to explain and change every line, and significant AI usage goes in the PR template. Submissions from autonomous agents are closed. [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) has the full rules, the PR checklist, and the testing commands.

### Development with VS Code

Use the included `.vscode/launch.json` to debug both server and web apps directly from VS Code.

Run `pnpm dev` in a terminal to start both apps, then use the "Debug All" configuration to attach the debugger.
